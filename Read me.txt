This is a smart door lock arduino project code. This code contains logic to connect to sinric pro which is how I am accessing this via google assitant. 

in siric pro the device type is set as SWITCH. this can be set to SMART LOCK which will add a pin code to unlock feature. For example when you say unlock door to google assitant, it will then ask for the pin. 
I have added the code that works with SMART LOCK type separately on a text file. 

I have used SWITCH type as this allows me to unlock without a pin which is faster. 

Issue with this approach is that it identifies as a switch. If i want to say "unlock the door", "open the door" etc, then i have to configure then from google asistant routines. 
I have configured the phrase "unlock the door" to trigger "turn off door lock switch"

Features
01. Unlocks / Locks via sinric or google assitant. 
02. Routines can be added to auto lock the door when you leave your house.
03. Status LED for wifi connectivity. Will blink while connecting. off when connected. 
04. does NOT maintain servo motor potition after setting it. This is done so that a failsafe method can be added to manually unlock if needed. If you want to eneble this then remove the line that detaches the servo. 
95. Physical button press to unlock / lock 

Features to be added
01. LED status indicator for lock / unlock state
02. Option to toggle auto unlock when wifi is disconnected. 

Features to be added with additional components
01. Adding dial pad to enter code to unlock.
02. Fingerprint unlock. (dial pad is needed with FP incase FP fails)


shedules to unlock / lock can be programmed however these can be done via routines much effectively.
