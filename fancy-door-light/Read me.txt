This contains the code for a lighting system for a door or a gate. You can use any suitable arduino and the following components. 

01. LED
02. Transistor (if the arduino is not capable of powering the LED dirrectly)
03. Switch 

For the transistor I have used BR8550. This is salvaged from an old circuit nothing special. Use a suitable transistor or even a mosfet.
For the switch I recommend a magnatic read switch. However you can use any suitable switch as the switch.

Features
01. LED turns on smoothly. Most important part duh. 
02. When door is closed (switch on) LED will stay up for 2 seconds and turn off smoothly. 

Features to be added. 
01. LDR sensor to detect the light level of the env and only turn on LED if env light is dim. 



Note :  This code can be easily added to the door lock code. I have tested this code with the door lock code which works without issues.
